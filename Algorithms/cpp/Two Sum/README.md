* A brute force solution will cost 109 ms.
* In hash solution (**unordered_map**):
	* Using **iterator** to save finding result, will cost 109 ms.
	* Directly use index only costs 9 ms.
* In sort solution (Line 7):
	* **<=** will cost 9 ms.
	* **<** will cost 7 ms.
	* The **size()** of **vector** can be used to define array.
