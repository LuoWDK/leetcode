* **The difference between Problem 10 & 44 is the definition of '*'**
* Recursion solution will cost 52 ms by using purning.
* Iteration solution will cost 49 ms.
* Dynamic solution:
	* It will cost 44 ms in **O(s.length() * p.length())** space complexity.
	* It will cost 55 ms in **O(2 * p.length())** space complexity.
	* It will cost 44 ms by traversing all **p** for each element in **s** within **O(p.length())** space complexity.
	* It will cost 46 ms by traversing all **s** for each element in **p** within **O(p.length())** space complexity.
